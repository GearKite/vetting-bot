# vetting-bot

(VERY WIP) bot to automate the process of vetting and welcoming new members

# Resources to understand/code the bot

- poll syntax for matrix protocol: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/main/proposals/3381-polls.md
- library for the bot: https://github.com/matrix-nio/matrix-nio

# What it should do

- Listen to commands on #vetting (quite easy)
- Invite potential new members to vetting channels (maybe less easy.
  Should there be a fixed number of channels?  Or should they be created
  on demand?  Both could pose some problems)
	- Maybe ask questions? (simple syntax for the potential member awaiting vetting to say they've finished a question, but otherwise
	  quite trivial)
	- Or send link to the cryptpad forms? (trivial, but needs cryptpad integration to send the form link/content to #vetting for voting)
- When all questions have been asked, start a vote in #vetting, and start a 36h timer (trivial)
- Synthesise matrix events responding to the poll (possibly non-trivial (see poll syntax)), and if there is no refusal, invite the new member
- Send welcome messages

# What I'm confused about

- How to make e2e encryption work?
- Should the bot interact with the user?
- should the bot send pdfs? Or should it send formatted matrix messages?
- should it rather send links, or rather send content?
